# Starlancer Moons
### New Moon: Auralis
>DESIGNATION: 42-Auralis

>RISK LEVEL: SS

>POPULATION: Officially abandoned, but reports claim to have heard the distant creak of springs.

>CONDITIONS: Perpetually overcast and soul-numbingly cold. The water here causes immediate hypothermia.

>FAUNA: The trees have eyes the dogs are without.

>HISTORY: A large facility nestled within the mountains once mass produced general goods. It's true function was to act as a facade for the company's ethically-questionable experiments. Surviving salvage teams have reported that the facility seems to shift each day, as if in constant flux.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Mild, Stormy, Foggy, Eclipsed

>ROUTING COST: 750

A frigid new moon featuring a lengthy trek to the dungeon, high enemy power limits, valuable scrap, and a treacherous fire exit path.

Auralis is slightly more expensive than Titan, to account for the distance and power limits, and should generally be regarded as more dangerous. There's a high probability of Forest Keepers and not much cover between the facility and the ship.
