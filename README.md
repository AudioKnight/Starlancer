# Starlancer
A modpack containing all of my Starlancer mods.

A WIP expansion mod for Lethal Company, currently featuring moons, custom music, a mechanics mod that allows enemies to move into and out of the facility while seamlessly switching AI, and patch to automatically assign the correct interior or exterior AI to an enemy when they spawn. More mods planned for the future!

# Starlancer Moons
### New Moon: Auralis
>DESIGNATION: 42-Auralis

>RISK LEVEL: SS

>POPULATION: Officially abandoned, but reports claim to have heard the distant creak of springs.

>CONDITIONS: Perpetually overcast and soul-numbingly cold. The water here causes immediate hypothermia.

>FAUNA: The trees have eyes the dogs are without. Flowers grow amongst the trees.

>HISTORY: A large facility nestled within the mountains once mass produced general goods. It's true function was to act as a facade for the Company's ethically-questionable experiments. Surviving salvage teams have reported that the facility seems to shift each day, as if in constant flux.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Mild, Stormy, Foggy, Eclipsed

>ROUTING COST: 800

A frigid new moon featuring a lengthy trek to the dungeon, high enemy power limits, valuable scrap, and a treacherous fire exit path.

Auralis is slightly more expensive than Titan, to account for the distance and power limits, and should generally be regarded as more dangerous. There's a high probability of Forest Keepers and not much cover between the facility and the ship.

### New Moon: Triskelion
>DESIGNATION: 27-Triskelion

>RISK LEVEL: B+

>POPULATION: Abandoned.

>CONDITIONS: A deteriorating mining platform situated above a gas giant.

>FAUNA: Winged entities stowed away on company vessels and now run rampant.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Mild, Stormy, Foggy, Eclipsed

>ROUTING COST: 350

An intermediate moon that features several fire exits, vertical gameplay, and encourages players to bring a weapon to fight off greedy entities.

Triskelion is designed to be an intermediate moon, priced below Rend while still not being cheap enough to immediately access (without mods that can increase starting credits). Baboon Hawks and Hoarding Bugs are common, so you might end up fighting for your loot. This moon is mostly populated with killable entities, so bring a shovel :)

### New Moon: Solace
>DESIGNATION: 74-Solace

>RISK LEVEL: B

>POPULATION: Abandoned, yet a large villa still stands.

>CONDITIONS: Normally tranquil, extreme weather has recently become more common.

>FAUNA: The company has received reports of both large and small dogs.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Mild, Rainy, Stormy, Foggy, Flooded, Eclipsed

>ROUTING COST: 0

A free moon that defaults toward the mansion tileset. Relatively peaceful, but certain weathers can be very troublesome.

# Starlancer AI Fix
A helper mod that automatically assigns the correct interior or exterior AI to an enemy when they spawn depending on if they are inside or outside of the dungeon. Also fixes a null reference exception regarding EnableEnemyMesh().
