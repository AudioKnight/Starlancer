# Starlancer
A WIP expansion mod for Lethal Company, currently featuring a new late-game moon, with new mechanics planned for the future!

This is a __very__ basic release of this mod to get some content out and generate interest. I have several ideas for the future to make this mod a truly unique addition to everyone's modlist. This is an ambitious project, so development will take some time.

__If you encounter any issues, please report them on GitHub or the Lethal Company Modding Discord server and I'll address them when I can.__

# New Moon: Auralis
>DESIGNATION: 42-Auralis

>RISK LEVEL: SSS

>POPULATION: ???

>CONDITIONS: Perpetually overcast and soul-numbingly cold. The water here causes immediate hypothermia.

>FAUNA: The trees have eyes the dogs are without.

>HISTORY: A large facility nestled within the mountains once mass produced general goods. It's true function was to act as a facade for the company's ethically-questionable experiments. Surviving salvage teams have reported that the facility seems to shift each day, as if in constant flux.

>POSSIBLE WEATHER: Mild, Stormy, Foggy, Eclipsed

>ROUTING COST: 800

A frigid new moon featuring a lengthy trek to the dungeon, high enemy power limits, valuable scrap, and a treacherous fire exit path.

Auralis is slightly more expensive than Titan, to account for the distance and power limits, and should generally be regarded as more dangerous. There's a high probability of Forest Keepers, and there's not much cover (yet) between the facility and the ship.
