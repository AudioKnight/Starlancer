- 0.1.4
  - Adjusted scrap spawn rates on Auralis and removed certain low-value scrap (don't worry, duckies _can_ still spawn, just very rarely). It should be much more profitable now on average.
  - Performance optimizations.
  - Small adjustment to interior enemy spawn rates.
  - Very small adjustment to dungeon size.

- 0.1.3
  - Performance optimizations.
  - Fixed an issue where walking into the lake wouldn't trigger water effects.
  - The path to the fire exit is now shorter.
  - Fog adjustment.
  - Added footstep sounds.
  - Changed the color of the sun.
  - Changed orbit prefab for Auralis to Moon3.

- 0.1.2
  - Fixed item dropship not appearing. (Note for other modders: This was caused by a change to the dropship object in Lethal Expansion.)
  - Raised starting height of falling snow.

- 0.1.1
  - Fixed navmesh issues.
  - Fixed scrap falling through landing pad.
  - Shifted a tree out of the way of the ship's landing sequence.
  - Adjusted the ice floe path. It's still treacherous, especially while encumbered, but it should be a bit easier to make the jumps.

- 0.1.0  
  - Initial Release.
  - Added custom moon "Auralis".
